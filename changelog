  "Thanks, everyone for helping us reach the incredibly 500 players daily, that's awesome!",
  "We are now aiming into releasing the 1.0.0 version, finally. Well, the main reason is that we are currently stable and also that the versioning system is kinda giving us a bunch of troubles.",
  "So, what are Game Toasts? They are a simple notification system that will appear into your screen that will notify you about something, currently, they can be, territory changes, new discoveries, completed quests, chest found and areas discovered.",
  "Now about the automatic chest marker, this thing works by when you FIND a chest and interact with it, it will be automatically marked into the map.",
  "Another good thing is that now you can have different configurations per user, so if your brother, for example, has another Minecraft account and plays at your computer, he will be able to have his own configurations.",
